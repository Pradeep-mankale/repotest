If you want to contribute to someone else's project but don’t have permission to make changes directly, you can create your own copy of the project
, make updates, and then suggest those updates for inclusion in the main project. This process is often called a "fork and pull request" workflow.

When you create your own copy (or "fork") of a project, it’s like making a new workspace that shares
code with the original project. This is useful for open-source projects or anytime you don’t have write access to the original project.
